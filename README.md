# Metronomical - Programmable Metronome
The aim of this metronome is to encourage exploration of odd meters and irregular patterns. Typical metronomes provide a steady
pulse which a musician can play along with, however, this is not useful for working on music in odd time signatures.
By removing any reference to a consistent grid of bars/measures and instead relying on simple rhythmic blocks, 
it is possible to discover new rhythmic possibilities.
